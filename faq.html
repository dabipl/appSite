                                   Using SharePoint Designer create two new workflows using specific workflow system on the site where you added your app, first using "Workflow 2010" and then using "Workflow 2013".
                                   Define workflow actions that will be sending e-mails.
                                   Publish and test those workflows.
                                   If the first workflow (2010 system) is not working then there is something wrong with standard workflow settings (possibly: SharePoint Time Service, Time Jobs).
                                   If the second workflow (2013 system) is not working then there is something wrong with the Workflow Manager configuration.

                                   When you install an app it gets regional, language and time zone settings same as the site where it was added. Those settings are copied and cannot be changed. So it is important to have correct site regional & language settings before you add an app from the Apps Store. If you have added an app to an invalid site then you need to create a new site that has correct regional & language settings and add this app there.
