                                   When you install an app it gets regional, language and time zone settings same as the site where it was added. Those settings are copied and cannot be changed. So it is important to have correct site regional & language settings before you add an app from the Apps Store. If you have added an app to an invalid site then you need to create a new site that has correct regional & language settings and add this app there.
